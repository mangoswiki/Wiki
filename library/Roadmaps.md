##MaNGOS Roadmap 2014

MaNGOS is still in a transition period while we continue to move from the old build to a new more redefined method.
- The method used in MaNGOS Zero was not 100% successful, work is continuing to revise and improve the windows experience from this.

###Goals for 2014

- Continued alignment of the cores. Different teams did things slightly differently and as a result we have similar functions in different cores using different names. This need tidying up

- Documenting the core, other groups shy away from this work as they feel it is beneath them. We are an educational group, documenting the core we help others learn.

- Continue to look at new ways to improve mangos, both from a technical aspect as well as a functional one.

- Developing better code, remove hardcoded values. Sadly some of our older developers never believed things would never change and hardcoded a lot of values in various areas of the core. This makes extending quite complex in places.

- Some of the database has been designed badly (playerbytes anyone), we intend to review and enhance the database where we can to improve performance and readability.

- More improvement to the server files to make them consistent across the cores.

- Continue our commitment to the Eluna project and add LUA support across the cores.

- Lastly, helping to teach more people for the core and scripting libraries work.

####We also recently asked our devs a question:
"If you wanted two things to put on the 'roadmap' for mangos for the coming year, what would they be ?"

* Look at streamlining the installation and upgrade process, in particular database upgrades
* Look at the concept of scripting things like spells, NPCs etc; there's no reason why a basic quest scripts should be a dozen lines long when the same thing could be done in a line or two in something like Lua or JavaScript.
* Have a clear view of what's working good, what needs work, what is broken ... also in terms of content (which instances work) that would be useful.
* Reorganise the project file system to all mangos branches and backport the Cryptography and Implemention as used in other projects. That way development can continue on Warden.
* We need some core cleanup perhaps, As in getting the core documented etc.
* DK rune system rewrite
* New virtual functions in scripts
* Full mingw support
* Dungeon finder
* Creature_difficulty system rewrite.
